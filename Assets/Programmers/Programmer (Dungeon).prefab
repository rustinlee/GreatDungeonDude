  - Where did I put my laptop...?
  - Man... where are all the babes at?
  - Honestly, you can't even get WiFi in here?
  - What are these supposed to be, goblins? Pssh.
  - I wish I was at home playing video games.
  - I was told there would be Mtn Dew.
  - Where did all my Doritos go?
  - Yeah, real nice dungeon. Super glad I'm here.
  - Do these things even *have* pathfinding?
  - Super great AI, real impressed.
  - What is that supposed to be, a sword?
  - You are the lamest adventurer I have ever seen.
  - I get the feeling this game was a rush job.
  - Two enemies. Mind blowing variety.
  - Who made this game? Six preschoolers?
